   Crewmate Handler Event

   This event runs constantly in the background and manages crewmates
   hired from the bar, including generating NPCs at the bar and managing
   crewmate conversation and behavior in space.

   TODO NOTES:
 
   - Missing tutorials and info about the following:
	* the crew wants stuff like food and water, so ideally you keep a few tons of food in your cargo
	* opening crates has hidden fees (restocking fruit)
	* salaries are paid when you land and eventually crew salaries
		synchronize if you don't land for many jumps
	* only the hired crew members that fit on the ship are "active" and usable
		-> this doesn't apply to officers and champions (aka crew that can do stuff)
	* a first officer can shuffle crew members (actually just moves
		rookies and low cadets near the back)
	* some types are incompatible (the characters will complain about it)
	* some types have limits (the characters will complain about it)
	* some types need bays to function (you can't have a guy launch a
		shark from a shark, but if you have 2 hyena bays already, sure...)
	* some crew refuse to work with others, but you can hire them in
		"the wrong order" to force them to work together
	* some crew have the same function as another but at a different price,
		and the salary is dependent on stats when hired, which are trainable,
		so it's actually a good idea to hire cheap crew and train it
	* a first officer acts like a normal manager at a bar, it's not until you're out
		in the lawlessness of space and jurisdiction of your own ship that you can
		finally do cool things. Same for the smuggler.
	* speaking of which -- the first officer can do some cool stuff
		that isn't explained anywhere like rename crew or throw out of airlock
	
	More TODO:
	- Promotion path from lieutenant to officer
	- ship_interior.facilities {} that can something like:
		- botanical	- produces 1 food every 30 periods or something
		- training	- converts crew satisfaction to xp?
		- some kind of research facilities, maybe gives upgrades to sensors or something
		- specialized facilities that consume a commodity to achieve some effect (e.g. ore + diamond = 100 hp armor)
			-> these ones would be meant for mining ships, or ships that can at least access materials easily
